-- LESSON 1
-- Creating Triggers
-- Create a new trigger that fires when deleting data
CREATE TRIGGER PreventDiscountsDelete
ON Discounts
-- The trigger should fire instead of DELETE
INSTEAD OF DELETE
AS
	PRINT 'You are not allowed to delete data from the Discounts table.';

-- Set up a new trigger
CREATE TRIGGER OrdersUpdatedRows
ON Orders
-- The trigger should fire after UPDATE statements
AFTER UPDATE
-- Add the AS keyword before the trigger body
AS
	-- Insert details about the changes to a dedicated table
	INSERT INTO OrdersUpdate(OrderID, OrderDate, ModifyDate)
	SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, GETDATE()
	FROM inserted;

-- Create a new trigger
CREATE TRIGGER ProductsNewItems
ON Products
AFTER INSERT
AS
	-- Add details to the history table
	INSERT INTO ProductsHistory(Product, Price, Currency, FirstAdded)
	SELECT Product, Price, Currency, GETDATE()
	FROM inserted;


-- Run an update for some of the discounts
UPDATE Discounts
SET Discount = Discount + 1
WHERE Discount <= 5;

-- Verify the trigger ran successfully
SELECT * FROM DiscountsHistory;


-- Add the following rows to the table
INSERT INTO SalesWithPrice (Customer, Product, Price, Currency, Quantity)

-- Practicing AFTER triggers
-- Create a new trigger for canceled orders
